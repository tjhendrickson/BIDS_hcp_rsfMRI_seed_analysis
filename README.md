# CORTADO

## Description 
This postprocessing pipeline is developed by the [University of Minnesota Informatics Institute](https://research.umn.edu/units/umii) for use by University of Minnesota neuroimaging researchers, and for open-source software distribution. CORTADO facilitates seed-based analysis with BIDS compatible CIFTI rsfMRI derivates from the [Human Connectome Project pipeline](https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines) by creating a robust and easy to use Singularity container, as will be described here. This software is intended to follow a "Glass Box" philosophy in that while this software is automated through the usage of containerization one can review this github repository to visually inspect the source code and methods used.
